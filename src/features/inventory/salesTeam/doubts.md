1. Is there need to fetch the drop downdata everytime the we load modal ? becuase if addition of data for that specific modal is rare, then we can just featch at start of the Page load once , and if that rare occasion does come , and the person cant find the dropdown he can just refersh the page once , and done

2. There is conditonal Api based on if the branch Type is Warehouse or store , cant we just load data of branch with a fields of its type , then fetch the desginations for both of them and Provide a if condition to the dropdown values by using react useState
